# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on cleaning up the Web Scraper Chatbot project by removing redundant files, fixing the infinite loop issue in OpenAI responses, and optimizing the overall project structure. The goal is to create a streamlined, production-ready codebase with clear separation of concerns and proper error handling.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to remove duplicate and unnecessary files from the project, so that the codebase is clean and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing the project structure THEN the system SHALL identify and remove redundant test files
2. WHEN cleaning up setup files THEN the system SHALL consolidate setup instructions into a single comprehensive guide
3. WHEN removing extra files THEN the system SHALL preserve only essential functionality files
4. WHEN cleaning up THEN the system SHALL maintain the core functionality of scraping and chatbot features

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the chatbot to stop going into infinite loops when processing OpenAI responses, so that I get clear, single responses to my questions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN asking a question THEN the chatbot SHALL provide exactly one response without looping
2. WHEN processing OpenAI API responses THEN the system SHALL handle the response properly without re-triggering
3. WHEN conversation history is managed THEN the system SHALL avoid duplicating messages that cause loops
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages without retrying indefinitely

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper error handling and API key validation, so that users get clear feedback about configuration issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an invalid API key is provided THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message with setup instructions
2. WHEN the API key is missing THEN the system SHALL guide users to the setup process
3. WHEN API rate limits are hit THEN the system SHALL provide informative error messages
4. WHEN network errors occur THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully without crashing

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want a streamlined project structure with clear documentation, so that I can easily understand and use the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the project THEN there SHALL be a single, comprehensive README file
2. WHEN setting up the application THEN there SHALL be clear, step-by-step instructions
3. WHEN running the application THEN all dependencies SHALL be properly specified
4. WHEN troubleshooting THEN there SHALL be helpful error messages and debugging information

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want optimized code structure with proper separation of concerns, so that the application is maintainable and extensible.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing the code THEN each module SHALL have a single, clear responsibility
2. WHEN handling API interactions THEN there SHALL be proper error handling and retry logic
3. WHEN managing state THEN the Streamlit session state SHALL be handled efficiently
4. WHEN processing scraped content THEN there SHALL be proper data validation and sanitization

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a macOS user, I want the Web Scraper Chatbot to work seamlessly on my system, so that I can use all features without platform-specific issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting environment variables THEN the system SHALL provide macOS-specific instructions using export commands
2. WHEN running the application THEN all file paths SHALL use forward slashes compatible with macOS
3. WHEN installing dependencies THEN the system SHALL work with macOS Python installations and virtual environments
4. WHEN handling SSL certificates THEN the system SHALL work with macOS certificate management
5. WHEN providing setup instructions THEN the documentation SHALL include macOS-specific commands and troubleshooting
6. WHEN using system resources THEN the application SHALL respect macOS security and permission requirements
